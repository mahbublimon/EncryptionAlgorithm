# RSA Encryption Algorithm

## Description

RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is a public-key cryptographic algorithm widely used for secure data transmission. It utilizes asymmetric key encryption, meaning it uses a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.

This Python library implements the RSA encryption algorithm, allowing users to encrypt and decrypt data securely.

## Installation

You can install RSA EncryptionAlgorithm using pip:

```bash
pip install RSAEncryptionAlgorithm
```

## Usage

```python
from RSAEncryptionAlgorithm import RSA

# Generate RSA keys
rsa = RSA()
public_key, private_key = rsa.generate_keypair()

# Encrypt plaintext
plaintext = 'Hello, world!'
ciphertext = rsa.encrypt(plaintext, public_key)
print('Encrypted:', ciphertext)

# Decrypt ciphertext
decrypted_text = rsa.decrypt(ciphertext, private_key)
print('Decrypted:', decrypted_text)
```
